# TaskSeq
An implementation `IAsyncEnumerableM<'T>` as a `taskSeq` CE for F# with accompanying `TaskSeq` module.

## Coming up!!! 

It's based on [Don Symes `taskSeq.fs`](https://github.com/dotnet/fsharp/blob/d5312aae8aad650f0043f055bb14c3aa8117e12e/tests/benchmarks/CompiledCodeBenchmarks/TaskPerf/TaskPerf/taskSeq.fs) but expanded with useful utility functions and a few extra binding overloads.
